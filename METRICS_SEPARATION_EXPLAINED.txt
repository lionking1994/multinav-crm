HOW METRICS ARE SEPARATED PER USER IN STAFF PERFORMANCE
================================================================================

CURRENT STATUS: ✅ METRICS ARE PROPERLY SEPARATED!

================================================================================
HOW IT WORKS
================================================================================

When calculating metrics for each staff member, the system:

1. FIRST filters activities to only that staff member's activities:
   - Line 75-83: staffActivities = only activities where createdBy = staff.email

2. THEN calculates metrics from ONLY those filtered activities:
   - Clients: Only clients from that staff's activities (line 85)
   - Navigation: Only navigation items from that staff's activities (line 88-92)
   - Services: Only services from that staff's activities (line 94-98)
   - Discharges: Only discharges from that staff's activities (line 100)

================================================================================
EXAMPLE WITH REAL DATA
================================================================================

Navigator (navigator@multinav.com):
- Has 8 activities (a1, a2, a3, a6, a7, a11, a12, a15)
- These activities involve specific clients: C4F2A1, C8B9D3, C1E0F5, etc.
- CLIENTS COUNT: Shows only the unique clients from THEIR activities
- NAVIGATION COUNT: Shows only navigation items from THEIR activities
- SERVICES COUNT: Shows only services from THEIR activities

Coordinator (coordinator@multinav.com):
- Has 6 activities (a4, a5, a8, a9, a13, a14)
- These activities involve different clients: C7A6B8, C2D3E4, C3D2E1, etc.
- CLIENTS COUNT: Shows only the unique clients from THEIR activities
- NAVIGATION COUNT: Shows only navigation items from THEIR activities
- SERVICES COUNT: Shows only services from THEIR activities

================================================================================
WHAT THIS MEANS
================================================================================

✅ ACTIVITIES: Each user sees only their activity count
✅ CLIENTS: Each user sees only clients they've worked with
✅ NAVIGATION: Each user sees only navigation items they provided
✅ SERVICES: Each user sees only services they accessed
✅ DISCHARGES: Each user sees only discharges they processed
✅ AVG/DAY: Calculated based on only their activities

================================================================================
HOW TO VERIFY
================================================================================

1. Login as navigator@multinav.com
2. Create a new activity for a specific client (e.g., John Smith)
3. Check Staff Performance:
   - Navigator's client count increases by 1 (if new client)
   - Navigator's navigation/services increase based on what you selected
   - Other users' counts remain unchanged

4. Login as coordinator@multinav.com
5. Check Staff Performance:
   - Coordinator doesn't see the navigator's new client in their count
   - Coordinator's metrics are completely separate

================================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

1. CLIENT MANAGEMENT vs CLIENT METRICS:
   - Client Management page: All users can see/edit all clients (shared)
   - Staff Performance metrics: Only counts clients YOU worked with

2. WHY CLIENTS ARE SHARED IN MANAGEMENT:
   - Multiple staff may work with the same client
   - Coordinators need to see all clients for oversight
   - Prevents duplicate client records

3. WHY METRICS ARE SEPARATED:
   - Fair performance evaluation
   - Individual accountability
   - Privacy between navigators
   - Accurate workload tracking

================================================================================
THE CODE THAT DOES THIS
================================================================================

StaffPerformance.tsx (lines 75-108):

// Filter to get only this staff member's activities
const staffActivities = filteredActivities.filter(a => 
    a.createdBy === staff.email || 
    a.createdByName === staff.name
);

// Count only clients from their activities
const clientsServed = new Set(staffActivities.map(a => a.clientId));

// Count only their navigation items
const navigationCount = staffActivities.reduce((sum, a) => {
    let count = a.navigationAssistance?.length || 0;
    return sum + count;
}, 0);

// Count only their services
const servicesCount = staffActivities.reduce((sum, a) => {
    let count = a.servicesAccessed?.length || 0;
    return sum + count;
}, 0);
