## ‚ö†Ô∏è EXPECTED BEHAVIORS

‚úÖ Date filtering (filters mock data)  
‚úÖ PDF export functionality  
‚úÖ Dark mode toggle  
‚úÖ Responsive design  
‚úÖ Form validations  
‚úÖ Charts and visualizations  

### What Won't Work (Needs Supabase):

‚ùå File uploads for resources  
‚ùå Real-time data sync

2. Go to Console tab
3. You should see:
   - `Supabase not configured, using mock data`
   - `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable not set`
   - These are expected without API keys

### Verify New Files Created:
The following new files should exist:
- ‚úÖ `/src/components/UnifiedReporting.tsx` - New reporting page
- ‚úÖ `/src/services/supabaseService.ts` - Database integration
- ‚úÖ `/src/hooks/useSupabase.ts` - React hook for data
